Radio is a private Discord bot for playing music, it is highly powerful and configurable. Radio is built to feel like a premium experience.

## Should I Run Radio Locally?

Probably not. Radio has enough moving pieces that running a local version is complicated. The main purpose of having the source released is to allow others to understand and audit the functionality. I don't plan on supporting folks trying to run locally. That said, feel free to run a local version of Radio for your server (but not a public version please).

### Self-hosting Agreement

- You may not use the Radio logo or name within derivative bots.
- You may not host a public version of Radio.
- You may not charge for the usage of your instance of Radio.
- You may not provide support for Radio.

### Can I Contribute?

Maybe. Feel free to submit PRs, but unless they are explicitly bug fixes that have good and clean code, I likely won't merge. Features will not be accepted through PR unless stated elsewhere. Do not submit feedback on this repository, the server is the right place for that.

## Can You Add Radio To My Server?

Maybe. If you are interested in having Radio on your server, please join [my server](https://discord.gg/8Nkgxg25Xw).
